            A BMI calculator is a tool that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI)
            based on a person's height and weight. It helps determine if an
            individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese,
            according to established categories. You can find online calculators
            that provide the BMI value and corresponding weight status.

          <ul>
            <p>Suggestion if you're Overweight</p>
            <li>
              Consult a Healthcare Professional: Start by talking to a doctor or
              a registered dietitian. They can help you create a personalized
              plan based on your health needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set Realistic Goals: Aim for gradual weight loss, such as 1-2
              pounds per week. Focus on establishing long-term lifestyle changes
              rather than quick fixes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
              Sometimes, thirst is mistaken for hunger.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be Mindful: Practice mindful eating by paying attention to your
              hunger cues, eating slowly, and savoring your food.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <p>Suggestion if you're Underweight</p>
            <li>
              Choose Nutrient-Dense Foods: Focus on foods that are high in
              calories but also nutritious, such as nuts, seeds, avocados, olive
              oil, and whole grains.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set Realistic Goals: Aim for gradual weight gain, such as 0.5 to 1
              pound per week. This can help ensure that weight gained is more
              likely to be muscle rather than fat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Eat More Frequently: Include 5-6 smaller meals or snacks
              throughout the day rather than three large meals to increase
              calorie intake.
            </li>
            <li>
              Limit Empty Calories: While it might be tempting to eat high-sugar
              or low-nutrient foods to gain weight, itâ€™s better to focus on
              nutrient-dense options for overall health.
